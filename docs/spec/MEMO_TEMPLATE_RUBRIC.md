## 2) Scoring Rubric

Each memo is scored by multiple analyst agents. Scores are 1-5.

1) Conviction
- Strength of thesis, clarity of mechanism, and evidence alignment.

2) Differentiation
- Novelty vs consensus; unique data or framing.

3) Magnitude
- Expected impact size and breadth.

4) Timing Clarity
- Presence of catalysts, signposts, and time window.

5) Reversibility
- Ability to exit or update view if conditions change.

6) Risk Awareness
- Quality and completeness of disconfirming evidence.

7) Evidence Quality
- Recency, corroboration, and source reliability.

## 3) Aggregation
- Weighted consensus score by agent role.
- Confidence band computed from score variance.
